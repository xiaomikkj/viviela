- [Routing System](routing-system.md): agent dispatch, session policy selection, and light/heavy model routing. ([ZH](routing-system.zh.md))
- [Runtime Events](runtime-events.md): runtime event envelope, centralized event logging, filters, and examples. ([ZH](runtime-events.zh.md))
- [Agent Self-Evolution](agent-self-evolution.md): learning records, draft generation, application modes, and state layout.
- [Hook System Guide](hooks/README.md): current hook architecture and protocol details.
- [Agent Refactor](agent-refactor/README.md): notes and checkpoints for the agent refactor work.
